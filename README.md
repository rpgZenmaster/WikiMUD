# wikimud

A wikiform state-based fiction content creation tool
In other words:
* A tool for creating a certain type of fiction
* The fiction must be "state-based", meaning the user moves from state to state; e.g. page to page, or room to room
* The user interacts with the tool in the same way they edit and update a wiki
